Problem 1
We repeatedly read from the keyboard integer numbers in an ArrayList structure.
The numbers are read until we input -1.
Traverse the ArrayList object (use get() method) and calculate if the numbers from the ArrayList are in a growing order.

 
Exemple:
nr=3
nr=30
nr=40
nr=-1

Answer: Yes, they are in a growing order.

Problem 2
There is the text file one.txt that contains a few lines of text.
Construct the text file two.txt that contains the same lines from the file one.txt, but each line is numbered, like in the following example.

Exemple:
If the file one.txt has the following 4 text lines:
mar
para 
kiwi
pruna

Than the file two.txt that has to be created will be:
1. mar
2. para
3. kiwi
4. pruna

Use BufferedReader and BufferedWriter Java classes , for the two text files.
