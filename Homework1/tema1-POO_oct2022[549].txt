Hello.

Here is your first assignment for this OOP course:
Develop a class Point that models a point in a plan (2D).
Instance variable: x, y : int (point coordinates)
Method:
 - constructor
- get() methods
- set() methods
- distance() that has another Point p as parameter and returns the distance between 
point p and the current point: public double distance(Point p)


Develop another class Test that has a main method in which we read N Point objects 
from the keybord an save them in an array  (vector) of Point: 
Point p[];
Compute which is the minimum distance between two points from the vector.
Which is the complexity of your algorithm ? O( ? )

Write also a method in Test class which has the array of Point as parameter and returns true
if all the points in the array are different (there are no two equal( i.e. same coordinates)
 points in the vector).


Send this homework, on my email, in one week.
